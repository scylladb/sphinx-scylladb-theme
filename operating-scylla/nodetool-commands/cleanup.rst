Nodetool cleanup
================
**cleanup** ``[<keyspace> <cfnames>...]``- Triggers the immediate cleanup of keys no longer belonging to a node. By default, clean all keyspaces. This command cleans keys that no longer belong to the node. If no key is specified all the keyspaces will be removed. Itâ€™s important to use the nodetool cleanup command when adding or removing nodes of a cluster.

For example:

To clean up the data of a specific node use this command:

.. code-block:: shell

   nodetool cleanup -h 127.0.0.1 keyspace1

.. note::

   If using Scylls Enterprise 2018.1.5, Scylla Open Source 2.2.0, 2.3.0 or lower version **Do not** run the ``nodetool cleanup`` command before upgrading to the latest release of your branch, see this issue_ for further information.
