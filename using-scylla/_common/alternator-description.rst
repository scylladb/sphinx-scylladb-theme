Scylla Alternator: The Open Source DynamoDB-compatible API (Experimental)

Project Alternator is an open-source project for an Amazon DynamoDB™-compatible API. The goal of this project is to deliver an open source alternative to Amazon’s DynamoDB, deployable wherever a user would want: on-premises, on other public clouds like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform, or still on AWS (for users who wish to take advantage of other aspects of Amazon’s market-leading cloud ecosystem, such as the high-density i3en instances). 

DynamoDB users can keep their same client code unchanged. 

Alternator is written in C++ and is a part of Scylla 3.2
