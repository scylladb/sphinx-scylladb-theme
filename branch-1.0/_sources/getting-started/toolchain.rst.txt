Toolchain
=========

Here are some basic concepts you should know before adding the doc toolchain to a project.

Markup language
---------------

Most docs are written in RestructuredText. RestructuredText is a file format for textual data used primarily for technical documentation.

Alternatively, you can also use :doc:`MarkDown <../examples/markdown>` to create content pages.

Sphinx
------

The tool we used to converts restructuredText and Markdown to HTML.
Sphinx also has directives and extensions to add additional options for formatting the text.

Scylla Sphinx Theme
-------------------

The theme all Scylla documentation projects share to have a common look and feel.
It also adds a set of custom functionallities available to make them available to all projects.

GitHub Actions
--------------

All the repositories deploy the documentation automatically except the repository scylla-docs, which is deployed manually.
