Substitutions
=============

Substitutions are variables. They are declared in any document and defined in the ``conf.py`` file, ``rst_prolog`` setting.
Do not use substitutions in headings. The reason is the text that replaces the variable may be longer than the line that is over or below the text and this will produce an error.
Refrain from making up substitutions without discussing it with the doc team first.

Currently, we are using the following substitutions:

* ``|v|`` for |v|
* ``|x|`` for |x|
