Lorem Ipsum: usage
------------------
Lorem ipsum is:

* a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content.
* Also called placeholder (or filler) text.
* A convenient tool for mock-ups.
* Helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout.
* Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero.

#. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical;
#. It's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore.
#. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever.
#. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearance of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

Lorem Ipsum: common examples
============================

Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Boundaries of Goods and Evils;
finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version
("Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it").
It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia;
he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.
