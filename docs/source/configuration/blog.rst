Blog Options
============

The theme supports the extension `ablog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to create a blog using Sphinx.

Scylla uses the extension to create the *What's new in the docs?* section on the main page.

For information on how to use ablog, check their `latest documentation <https://github.com/sunpy/ablog>`_
