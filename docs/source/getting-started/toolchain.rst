Toolchain
=========

Here are some concepts you should know before adding the doc toolchain to a project.

Markup language
---------------

We recommend using **reStructuredText** markup language to write documentation.
Additionally, the toolchain supports :doc:`Markdown <../configuration/markdown>`.

Sphinx
------

The tool we use to convert restructuredText and Markdown to HTML.
Sphinx comes with directives and extensions, which add additional options for formatting the text.

ScyllaDB Sphinx Theme
---------------------

All ScyllaDB documentation projects share a theme to have a common look and feel.
In addition, ScyllaDB Sphinx Theme preinstalls a set of custom functionalities to make them available for all projects.

We use the third-party extension ``sphinx-multiversion`` to build docs for different versions.
