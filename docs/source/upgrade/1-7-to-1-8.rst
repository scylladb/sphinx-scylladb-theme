Migrating from 1.7 to 1.8
=========================

This guide explains how to upgrade the version of the ScyllaDB Sphinx Theme.

How to check your current theme version
---------------------------------------

The theme version is displayed in the footer of the project's documentation site.

If your project theme's version is **>=1.7**, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.8
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.6 and 1.7 versions.

Commit the poetry.lock file to the repository
.............................................

We recommend that teams commit the ``poetry.lock`` file to the repository. 
Doing so ensures that dependencies are locked, leading to consistent documentation builds across different environments.
For more information, see `Committing your poetry.lock file to version control <https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#committing-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control>`_.

Steps to apply this change:

#. Remove the ``poetry.lock`` file from the ``.gitignore`` file. This file could be either in the root of the repository or in the ``docs`` directory.

#. Update the ``docs/Makefile`` and remove the ``rm -f poetry.lock`` command from the ``clean`` command:

    .. code-block::

        # Clean commands
        .PHONY: clean
        clean:
            rm -rf $(BUILDDIR)/*
            # rm -f poetry.lock


#. Add the following ``dependabot.yml`` configuration file in the ``.github`` directory:

    .. literalinclude:: _partials/dependabot_template.yml

   This configuration helps keep your project up-to-date with the latest theme versions automatically.

#. In the ``docs/pyproject.toml`` file, set Poetry to use the non-package mode:

    .. code-block::

        [tool.poetry]
        name = "scylla"
        description = "Scylla Documentation"
        version = "4.3.0"
        authors = ["ScyllaDB Contributors"]
        package-mode = false

#. Ensure all dependencies in the ``docs/pyproject.toml`` file are configured to install the latest minor versions by using the ``^`` symbol followed by the major and minor version number:

    Example:

    .. code-block::

        (...)

        [tool.poetry.dependencies]
        python = "^3.10"
        pygments = "^2.18.0"
        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "^1.6.1"
        myst-parser = "^3.0.1"
        sphinx-autobuild = "^2024.4.16"
        Sphinx = "^7.3.7"
        sphinx-multiversion-scylla = "^0.3.1"
        sphinx-sitemap = "^2.6.0"
        redirects_cli ="^0.1.3"

        (...)

#. In the same ``docs/pyproject.toml`` file, update the poetry dependency to version 1.8.0:

    .. code-block:: python

        (...)
        [build-system]
        requires = ["poetry>=1.8.0"]
        build-backend = "poetry.masonry.api" 

#. Commit the changes to the repository, including the ``poetry.lock`` file.

Update mascots and icons

If your homepage was using mascots or icons, update them to the new ones.
