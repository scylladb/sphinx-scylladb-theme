Migrating from 1.6 to 1.7
=========================

This guide explains how to upgrade the version of the ScyllaDB Sphinx Theme.

How to check your current theme version
---------------------------------------

The theme version is displayed in the footer of the project's documentation site.

If your project theme's version is **>=1.6**, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.7
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.6 and 1.7 versions.

#. To ensure documentation builds when backporting content to previous branches, update the ``.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`` workflow file as outlined below:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        (...)
        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - master # Replace with your default branch name
            - 'branch-**' # Use the versioned branch pattern
            paths:
            - "docs/**"
        workflow_dispatch:

        jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: Checkout
                uses: actions/checkout@v4
                with:
                ref: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
                persist-credentials: false
                fetch-depth: 0
            - name: Set up Python
                uses: actions/setup-python@v5
                with:
                python-version: '3.10'
            - name: Set up env
        (...)

#. The theme no longer supports Amplify. If your project includes the ``.github/actions/amplify-enhanced`` directory, the ``.github/workflows/docs-amplify-enhanced.yml`` workflow, or an ``amplify.yml`` file, consider removing them and move to the new approach. For more information, see :doc:`Pull requests previews <../deployment/previews>`.
