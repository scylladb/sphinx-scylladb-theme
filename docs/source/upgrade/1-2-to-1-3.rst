Migrating from 1.2 to 1.3
=========================

This guide explains how to upgrade the version of the ScyllaDB Sphinx Theme.

How to check your current theme version
---------------------------------------

The theme version is displayed in the footer of the project's documentation site.

If your project theme's version is **>=1.2**, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.3
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.2 and 1.3 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.3.1"
        redirects_cli ="~0.1.3"

#. Add the new `redirects` command in ``docs/Makefile``:

    .. code-block::

        .PHONY: redirects
        redirects: setup
            $(POETRY) run redirects-cli fromfile --yaml-file ./_utils/redirects.yaml --output-dir $(BUILDDIR)/dirhtml
            @echo
            @echo "Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/dirhtml."

#. Create a new file ``docs/_utils/redirects.yml``. If the project has a file ``docs/_utils/redirections.yml``, rename it to ``docs/_utils/redirects.yml`` and update it to the new format:

    Before, redirects were created for all versions:

    .. code-block::

        test-redirect: /stable/index

    If the project were building docs for the branches ``stable`` and ``branch-1.0``, it would generate the following redirections:

        * ``/stable/test-redirect`` -> ``/stable/index``
        * ``/branch-1.0/test-redirect`` -> ``/stable/index``

    Now, you have more control to define redirects per version. To create the same redirects as in the previous example, the new format is:

    .. code-block::

        /stable/test-redirect.html: /stable/index.html
        /branch-1.0/test-redirect.html: /stable/index.html

    .. note:: Notice that now you must append the ``.html`` extension to the redirects.

#. Remove the file ``.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml``. Then, copy the new workflow in the ``.github/workflows`` folder. You can download the latest `docs-pages.yml` workflow `here <https://github.com/scylladb/sphinx-scylladb-theme/tree/master/.github/workflows>`_.

    If the default branch is not ``master`` or the docs are not under the ``docs`` folder, the workflows to match the project configuration. For example:

    .. code-block::

        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - master # edit this line
            paths:
            - "docs/**" # edit this line

#. Commit and push the changes to GitHub (default branch).

To check if the upgrade completed successfully, run the command :doc:`make preview <../../commands>`.
Then, check if the site footer displays version 1.3 or greater.

Optional features
------------------

Build previews only if the docs folder is updated
.................................................

If the project is deploying docs pull request previews with AWS Ampify, you can update the configuration to improve the build time:

1. Replace the ``amplify.yml`` in your root directory with the `latest version <https://github.com/scylladb/sphinx-scylladb-theme/blob/master/amplify.yml>`_.
2. Follow the guide :ref:`Build previews only if the docs folder is updated <enable_previews_doc_folder_updated>`.
3. Set the base image to build the docs to ``python:3.8`` as described in :ref:`Configure build settings <configure_build_settings>`.
