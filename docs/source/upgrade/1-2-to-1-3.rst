If your project theme's version is **>=1.2**, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.3
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.2 and 1.3 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.3.0"
        redirects_cli ="0.1.0"

#. Add the new `redirects` command in ``docs/Makefile``:

    .. code-block::

        .PHONY: redirects
        redirects: setup
            $(POETRY) run redirects-cli fromfile --yaml-file ./_utils/redirects.yaml --output-dir $(BUILDDIR)/dirhtml
            @echo
            @echo "Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/dirhtml."

#. Remove the file ``.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml``. Then, copy the new workflow in the ``.github/workflows`` folder. You can download the latest `docs-pages.yml` workflow `here <https://github.com/scylladb/sphinx-scylladb-theme/tree/master/.github/workflows>`_.

    If the default branch is not ``master`` or the docs are not under the ``docs`` folder, the workflows to match the project configuration. For example:

    .. code-block::

        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - master # edit this line
            paths:
            - "docs/**" # edit this line

#. Commit and push the changes to GitHub (default branch).

To check if the upgrade completed successfully, run the command :doc:`make preview <../../commands>`.
Then, check if the site footer displays version 1.3 or greater.
