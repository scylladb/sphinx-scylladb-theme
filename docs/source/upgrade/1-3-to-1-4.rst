Upgrade to version 1.4
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.3 and 1.4 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.4.1"

#. Edit the ``docs/Makefile`` file and add the ``rm -f poetry.lock`` to the ``clean`` command:

    .. code-block::

        # Clean commands
        .PHONY: clean
        clean:
            rm -rf $(BUILDDIR)/*
            rm -f poetry.lock

#. Build the docs locally:

    .. code-block::

        cd docs
        make preview

#. Fix any warnings that appear in the terminal.
