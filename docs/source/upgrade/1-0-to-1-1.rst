#. Install `Poetry 1.12 <https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/>`_ or later on your computer.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        [tool.poetry.dependencies]
        python = "^3.7"
        pyyaml = "^6.0"
        pygments = "^2.11.2"
        recommonmark = "^0.7.1"

        Sphinx = "^4.3.2"
        sphinx-multiversion-scylla = "~0.2.10"

#. In ``conf.py``, remove the option ``"hide_sidebar_index": "true"`` (if exists).

	.. note:: Depending on your project configuration, you may find ``conf.py`` under ``docs/source/conf.py`` or ``docs/conf.py``.

#. Edit ``docs/Makefile``:

	#. Replace:

            .. code-block::

                POETRY = $(HOME)/.poetry/bin/poetry

            With:

            .. code-block::

                POETRY = $(HOME)/.local/bin/poetry

	#. Replace:

            .. code-block::

                .PHONY: setup
                setup:
                    ./_utils/setup.sh

            With:

            .. code-block::

                .PHONY: setup
                setup:
                    $(POETRY) install
                    $(POETRY) update

#. Remove the file ``docs/_utils/setup.sh``.

            - master # edit this line
            paths:
            - "docs/**" # edit this line

#. Commit and push the changes to GitHub (default branch).
