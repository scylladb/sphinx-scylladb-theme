Upgrade to version 1.6
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.5 and 1.6 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.6.1"
        pyyaml = "6.0.1"
        Sphinx = "7.2.6"
        sphinx-multiversion-scylla = "~0.3.1"
        sphinx-sitemap = "2.5.1"

#. Open ``docs/Makefile`` file and remove the following lines:

    .. code-block::

        # Windows variables
        ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
            POETRY = $(APPDATA)\Python\Scripts\poetry
        endif

    .. note::

        If you are on Windows, ensure that Poetry is configured in your system's PATH.
        For guidance on how to add Poetry to your PATH, refer to the `Poetry documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_.

#. Build the docs locally:

    .. code-block:: console

        cd docs
        make preview

#. Review and address any warnings that may arise in the terminal during the build process.
