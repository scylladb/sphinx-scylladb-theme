Upgrade to version 1.2
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.1 and 1.2 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-multiversion-scylla = "~0.2.11"

#. Edit ``docs/Makefile``:

	#. Replace:

            .. code-block::

                POETRY = $(HOME)/.local/bin/poetry

            With:

            .. code-block::

                # Windows variables
                ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
                    POETRY = $(APPDATA)\Python\Scripts\poetry
                endif

    #. Add:

            .. code-block::

                 # Setup commands
                .PHONY: setupenv
                setupenv:
                    pip install -q poetry


#. Remove the files ``.github/workflows/docs-*.yml``. Then, copy the new workflows in the ``.github/workflows`` folder. You can download the latest workflows `here <https://github.com/scylladb/sphinx-scylladb-theme/tree/master/.github/workflows>`_.

    If the default branch is not ``master`` or the docs are not under the ``docs`` folder, the workflows to match the project configuration. For example:

    .. code-block::

        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - master # edit this line
            paths:
            - "docs/**" # edit this line

#. Commit and push the changes to GitHub (default branch).

To check if the upgrade completed successfully, run the command :doc:`make preview <../../commands>`.
Then, check if the site footer displays version 1.2 or greater.

#. Add a new option ``versions_unstable`` in ``html_options``:

    .. code-block:: python
