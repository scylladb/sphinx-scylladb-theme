If your project theme's version is **>=1.4**, follow this guide to get the latest version.

Upgrade to version 1.5
----------------------

Here are the main breaking changes between the 1.4 and 1.5 versions.

#. Update the following Python dependencies in ``docs/pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-scylladb-theme = "~1.5.1"
        pygments = "2.15.1"
        sphinx-sitemap = "2.5.0"

#. In the `conf.py` file, update the options for the sitemap extension as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        # -- Options for sitemap extension ---------------------------------------

        sitemap_url_scheme = "/stable/{link}"

    Note that the ``sitemap_url_scheme`` must start with a slash.

#. Within the same `conf.py` file, edit the HTML theme options to enable the newly introduced feature for collecting user feedback:

    .. code-block:: python

        html_theme_options = {
            "hide_feedback_buttons": 'false',
        }

#. Build the docs locally:

    .. code-block:: console

        cd docs
        make preview

#. Review and address any warnings that may arise in the terminal during the build process.
