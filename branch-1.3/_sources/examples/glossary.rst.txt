Glossary
========

Using the glossary.rst page you can create a glossary. The terms can be entered in any order and it will create an alphabetical list.
Terms need to be written with a hanging indent from the definition. Consult the Glossary Template for details.

To cite a term in a document that is not the glossary use the following convention:

.. code-block:: rst

   :term:`term <term as written in Glossary>`

For example:

.. code-block:: rst

   :term:`Size-tiered Compaction Strategy (STCS)<Size-tiered Compaction Strategy>`

Abbreviations and acronyms are defined in-line. The initial letters or abbreviation is first followed by the longer form.
For example:

.. code-block:: rst

   :abbr:`LIFO (last-in, first-out)`.

.. code-block:: rst

   :abbr:`Overwrite (Same data cells overwritten many times)`
